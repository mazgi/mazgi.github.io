        <h1>Best PCs and Environments for Web Developers in 2021</h1>
      </div>
      <h2 id="the-purpose-of-this-article">The Purpose of this Article</h2>
<p>In this article, I describe PCs and development environments I recommend for those who want to become a web developer.<br>
I&rsquo;ll not only list up PCs but also describe why I use them and how.</p>
<p>When you develop web systems, PCs and development environments are the things you will deal with first and continue working with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful for you to understand if you want to acquire skills efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, this will help you imagine yourself working as a web developer and find a workplace that matches your desire and aptitude.</p>
<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in Japan as an IT developer for over ten years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been engaged as a web developer mainly in designing and developing web systems, but previously I was developing enterprise systems such as finance and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The PCs, development environments and those combinations that I&rsquo;ll describe are based on my experience.</p>
<h2 id="to-wrap-up-first">To Wrap Up First</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing my recommendation, assuming you&rsquo;ll have to get the whole setup from scratch.</p>
<p>However, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to buy a new PC immediately, even if your PC is different from the ones in this article.</p>
<p>Read this article and use it as reference as to how to utilize the PCs that you already have or which ones to buy next.</p>
<p><strong>For your First PC I recommend you buy an Apple Laptop that has Intel inside.</strong></p>
<p>The models and display size could be anything you like, but you should make sure it has over 16GB of memories and as much storage as you can buy.</p>
<p><strong>If you are thinking of having a second PC, I recommend a Windows Desktop PC that is BTO or Homebuilt.</strong></p>
<p>These are better value for money and have the flexibility of extended memory and storage.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I want you to try Cloud Platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud!</strong></p>
<p>You can make an account on these cloud platforms for free, and you can create your development environments on that for a small fee.</p>
<h2 id="first-pc-an-apple-laptop">First PC: An Apple Laptop</h2>
<p>If you are buying a PC for web development, I recommend you first choose a laptop type Mac, such as MacBook Air, MacBook Pro.<br>
Though this doesn&rsquo;t come cheap, you should be able to use it for two to five years so you can plan your budget accordingly.</p>
<p>As previously stated, your priority should be to secure over 16GB of memory and as much storage as possible.<br>
Besides that, CPU performance, display size, number of USB-C ports are essential factors too.</p>
<p>However, CPU performance will be limited as long as it is a laptop.<br>
If you really need higher CPU performance, I recommend using desktop PCs as I&rsquo;ll state next.</p>
<p>Next, you might be interested in determining the display size, but you can connect other displays and use them as multi-display.</p>
<p>So, you can choose it depending on price and portability.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, many web developers are using Macs with external displays at their offices and homes. I&rsquo;m doing this too.<br>
If you want to use multiple displays, you should make sure how many displays the Mac will allow you to connect.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is while more USB-C ports are better than fewer ports, if you want to use a mouse and keyboard via USB, then you can connect these with a USB hub or a USB-C to USB-A adapter.<br>
Or you can also use these devices wirelessly via Bluetooth.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-recommend-macs">Why I recommend Macs</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give three reasons why I recommend a Mac as your first PC when you are becoming a web developer.</p>
<p><strong>1. As a new web developer, you&rsquo;ll be able to gather more information on Macs.</strong></p>
<p>Macs are provided solely by Apple, which designs and sells their hardware and OS.<br>
Thus, Macs have limited worldwide lineups than Windows PCs make by many manufactures in various countries.</p>
<p>This quality of Apple may feel limiting if you want to select details freely from many options, but at the same time, it also offers many advantages.</p>
<p>The primary one is the amount of information.</p>
<p>Macs have fewer models which are released globally, making it easier to gather a lot of information for starting web development.</p>
<p>By the way, you typically run into many obstacles when you start a new thing.<br>
These obstacles are easier to deal with once you get the hang of web development, but these could consume your time and be a pain to deal with until you get used to it.</p>
<p>However, the obstacles you run into at the initial stage as a web developer are usually already resolved by other pioneers.<br>
These examples obviously become more prevalent as more people go through the same conditions.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a high possibility that obstacles related to Mac models have already been published on various blogs and Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<p>So, if you choose a Mac, you can tap into these solutions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Macs have user-friendly ecosystems for web development.</strong></p>
<p>Macs are pre-installed with a macOS, a type of UNIX like OS, which is suitable for web applications.</p>
<p>Modern web systems are almost all provided on Linux, which is also a UNIX like OS.</p>
<p>The first world wide web site was invented on UNIX like OS, and Facebook, Twitter, and other popular web services are also provided on Linux today.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">The birth of the Web</a></p>
<p>The web systems you develop from now on will probably be provided on Linux, similar to the ones I mentioned above.</p>
<p>So, Macs and macOS are an excellent choice for your web development environment in order to deploy on Linux, which are both similar UNIX type OS.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I mentioned above, since many web developers are using Macs, many tools and methods are available on macOS.<br>
For example, my co-workers and I use many toolchains that can be installed via &ldquo;<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>,&rdquo; a package manager for macOS.</p>
<p>Aside from these UNIX like OS and ecosystems, you might need the following applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor / IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> IDEs, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphics Editor
<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop, Figma, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Office Suite
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With macOS, you have the benefit of both these native applications and toolchains.</p>
<p><strong>3. Macs could be used to develop many systems.</strong></p>
<p>While you&rsquo;ll be studying web development, you might become curious or have to develop other systems that are not related to the web.</p>
<p>If you happen to get a good job and the recruiter says, &ldquo;We want you to develop a web application. Additionally, we are hoping you develop smartphone apps.&rdquo; If so, what will you do?<br>
You&rsquo;ll probably want to try to develop smartphone apps unless you have resentment about that.</p>
<p>In terms of smartphone apps for Android, this could be developed on both macOS or Windows.<br>
However, in reality, iOS apps require a Mac and macOS to develop.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you need two OSs, a macOS and a Windows, you can run the Windows on the macOS using virtualization technology.<br>
In other words, if you have a Mac, you can manage to use or develop applications for Windows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Apple ToA will not allow you to run macOS on Windows or create the same exact development environments as Mac for iOS.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to develop web applications mainly and smartphone apps supplementary, Macs are the right choice.</p>
<p>However, if you want to develop VR applications and 3DCG games, I recommend you choose Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Silicons: Not Yet Recommendable</strong></p>
<p>Apple has been using Intel CPUs for a while, but they have announced Apple Silicon in 2020, a new CPU designed by themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">Apple announces Mac transition to Apple silicon</a></p>
<p>The CPUs on Macs up until now have been made by Intel and were the same as the ones on Windows PCs. However, Apple Silicon is based on Arm Ltd.&rsquo;s technology, more similar to iPhones and iPads than ordinary PCs.</p>
<p>From a developer&rsquo;s perspective, when the CPU changes, their &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">Instruction set architecture</a>&rdquo; also change, so confusions such as toolchains not working might happen right after release.</p>
<p>Additionally, of course, only a few people will be using these new Macs right after release, so there is limited information available.</p>
<p>New Macs powered by Apple Silicon is rumored to be released at the end of 2020.<br>
Still, I recommend you keep using Macs powered by Intel CPU and wait for a few months to a year until the developing ecosystem matures.</p>

<h3 id="why-i-recommend-laptops">Why I Recommend Laptops</h3>
<p>Learning from someone is a good method when you want to learn something from scratch.</p>
<p>If you choose a laptop instead of a desktop as your first PC, you could get someone knowledgeable to look at it when problems occur and give you appropriate advice.</p>
<p>Apple Stores have a Genius Bar. Even if you are using a laptop that is not a Mac, you could get advice if you carry your laptop to the customer support desk at the store you purchased your laptop from.<br>
Likewise, if you want to buy a PC accessory, you can carry your laptop to the store and ask the clerks, &ldquo;can I use this device on this laptop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides that, you can carry your laptop to conferences and workshops which would be an advantage.<br>
You could also carry your laptop to an interview and demonstrate to the recruiter the web applications you developed.<br>
Additionally, you can use your laptop at a cafe or in a different room in your home for a change of pace, which is an added benefit.</p>
<p>As stated, ease of carrying is a significant advantage, so I recommend having one laptop.</p>
<p>Incidentally, from a web development perspective, the performance difference of laptops and desktops don&rsquo;t matter as much as before.<br>
As a matter of fact, there are web developers who develop web applications on only one laptop.</p>
<h2 id="second-pc-build-to-order-or-homebuilt-windows-pcs">Second PC: Build to Order or Homebuilt Windows PCs</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, it is possible to do everything on one laptop.<br>
Although, if you plan to have a second PC, I recommend the following desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Homebuilt PCs</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get a brand new desktop PC, homebuilt is the most flexible and it might even be cheaper.</p>
<p>Does building a PC seem difficult to you? However, you only need a Philips screwdriver.<br>
You select parts such as a CPU, memory, motherboard, SSD and various other parts, connect the cables and terminals and screw the parts together.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can buy the above parts on Amazon and other EC sites, without even having to go to the shops.</p>
<p>However, if it&rsquo;s your first time, you might also feel building a PC doesn&rsquo;t look easy.<br>
When you build a PC, it will probably be a process of trial-and-error. In some cases, you might even end up breaking a part.</p>
<p>If you feel such a risk is not worth your time, I recommend selecting BTOs as I&rsquo;ll describe later.</p>
<p>Besides, some shops sell whole sets of PC parts for you to assemble a desktop PC.<br>
This is a good choice if you lack the confidence to select parts or don&rsquo;t want to spend the time.</p>
<p><strong>BTO</strong></p>
<p>Also called &ldquo;Make to Order.&rdquo;<br>
This is an approach using a shop built PC sold with pre-selected PC parts.</p>
<p>Thus, you get the latest performance PC at a low price that is nearly equivalent to the cost of the parts and assembly.<br>
I&rsquo;m not that familiar with the latest situation, but tour could find many e-commerce sites when you google &ldquo;Build to Order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some shops line up models according to categories such as &ldquo;Low Cost,&rdquo; &ldquo;High Performance.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gaming,&rdquo; and others, so you could choose the most suitable one.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-recommend-homebuilt-or-bto-pcs">Why I Recommend Homebuilt or BTO PCs?</h3>
<p>Why do I recommend homebuilt or BTO instead of ready-made PCs?</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to replace your PC if you already have one.<br>
Moreover, if you are blessed with the chance of being able to acquire a ready-made PC at a bargain, you can make use of such deals.</p>
<p>However, having a PC homebuilt or BTO brings the following advantages.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Having a Desktop 1: Offload Your Tasks and Data</strong></p>
<p>As of 2020, laptop performances are high, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about web development on those.<br>
However, memories and storages can&rsquo;t be extended on Apple laptops, and Windows laptops' extensibility is also limited.</p>
<p>If you have a desktop PC besides a laptop, you can transfer archived data and distribute heavy tasks on the desktop.<br>
Homebuilt or BTO PCs especially have much flexibility, so you can extend storage and add devices by attaching parts.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, you need to set up a basic home network to use two or more PCs, but this network is a subset of ordinary offices, so setting up basic networks will be a useful skill to have.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Having a Desktop 2: A Fallback when Your Laptop is Broken</strong></p>
<p>These days, sending back and repairing a laptop might end up taking a long time.<br>
If you have another PC, you&rsquo;ll be able to continue working while waiting for the repair.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if your other PC is BTO or homebuilt, you could repair it yourself by buying the parts and replacing them.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Having a Desktop 3: Make a More Comfortable Development Environment</strong></p>
<p>When you get used to developing, you might feel like coding with more displays and listening to music.<br>
Even in this case, you could improve graphic cards and use multiple displays. You could also add storage and memory.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-recommend-windows">Why I Recommend Windows?</h3>
<p>Why do I recommend Windows as your second PC even though I recommended Macs as your first PC?<br>
The reasons are good value for money and extendibility.</p>
<p>Most Macs don&rsquo;t allow replacement storage after buying.<br>
Because the storage tips are soldered to the board.<br>
Moreover, if you expand the storage to maximum capacity upon purchase, the price goes up about one whole PCs' worth.</p>
<p>The only exception is Mac Pro which the storage could be replaced after purchase, but this one has a tower shape, and the minimum price starts at <code>$5.999</code>.<br>
This model is not suited for web development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Windows PCs are available from a few hundred dollars.<br>
Additionally, on Windows PCs, each part can be replaced, so you&rsquo;ll be able to increase the performance by adding and replacing parts.</p>
<p>However, you should keep in mind the following points about Windows.</p>
<p><strong>About Windows Licenses</strong></p>
<p><em>Actually, I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/">Visual Studio Subscriptions</a> user, so I&rsquo;m not that familiar with the Windows Licenses for general consumers.</em><br>
<em>If anyone knows any good articles on this topic, please tell me.</em></p>
<p>Windows is not a free OS. There are several variations to the license.<br>
You need to be watch out because some licenses will only allow certain PCs or parts.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Home or Windows Pro</strong></p>
<p>Windows has several editions.<br>
The Home edition, the cheaper one, is enough for most situations.<br>
However, if you choose the Pro edition, the following features might be useful from a development perspective.</p>
<p>One of them is Hyper-V.</p>
<p>This is a virtualization feature made by Microsoft that runs Linux and other OSs on Windows.<br>
There are ways to use virtualization on the Home edition but Pro edition is easier to virtualize.</p>
<p>The other one is Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>On Pro edition, you can connect your Windows from other PCs via Remote Desktop.<br>
This feature is useful for example, when you are using a laptop in the living room, and you want to run a small task from the desktop PC in your den.<br>
Moreover, you can place the desktop at the back of your desk without a display and keyboard and use it as a server.</p>
<h2 id="using-cloud-services">Using Cloud Services</h2>
<p>My final recommendation is to use cloud services.<br>
If you have at least one PC, you can start using cloud services.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is almost no situation where cloud services aren&rsquo;t used.</p>
<p>In terms of web systems, cloud services are even starting to be utilized by enterprise systems such as banks, governments, and others.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure the company you&rsquo;ll work for is using some kind of cloud services.</p>
<p>Gartner says, in 2019, cloud services have the following shares.<br>
<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-08-10-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-point-3-percent-in-2019">Gartner Says Worldwide IaaS Public Cloud Services Market Grew 37.3% in 2019</a></p>
<ol>
<li>AWS: <code>45.0 %</code></li>
<li>Azure: <code>17.9 %</code></li>
<li>Alibaba Cloud: <code>9.1 %</code></li>
<li>Google Cloud Platform: <code>5.3 %</code></li>
<li>Tencent: <code>2.8 %</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using AWS, Azure, Google Cloud. Many companies are also using them, and you could start using them with just one credit card.<br>
If I have the opportunity later, I wish to describe cloud services themselves and how to use them.</p>
<p>For now, I would like you to know that you could run a Linux virtual machine on the cloud and use it as a web development environment.<br>
This is the most basic case of cloud use, and you could try it from a few cents per hour.</p>
<p>I recommend you try to use cloud services to get used to web systems in the 2020s.</p>
<h3 id="precautions-using-cloud">Precautions Using Cloud</h3>
<p>Cloud services are very useful but you want to pay attention to two points.<br>
Both points are related to cost.</p>
<p><strong>Point 1: You Should Stop Your Resources after Using</strong></p>
<p>Cloud service charges are basically paid by the hour, including resources such as Linux virtual machines.<br>
Even a Linux virtual machine that only costs a few cents an hour will end up being thirty to fifty dollars if you keep running it for a month.</p>
<p>You should turn off or terminate the resources you have used, and you may want to check your billing dashboard regularly not only on that day.<br>
Setting up billing alert emails is also useful.</p>
<p><strong>Point 2: Don&rsquo;t Let Your Credentials Leak</strong></p>
<p>You can connect to the cloud from anywhere.<br>
This is a point both useful and dangerous which is different from your home or office PC network.</p>
<p>If anyone gets hold of the credentials you issued, they are able to steal your identity and create resources on the cloud.<br>
For example, there is a risk of impostors mining cryptocurrencies in your name and you&rsquo;ll be responsible for the payment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I haven&rsquo;t experienced such incidents, but you hear stories of credentials being published as sample codes occurring every year.<br>
People and organizations aiming to steal your credentials exist, and they will immediately get hold of this information the moment you let it leak.</p>
<p>So, you need to take care to not allow credentials to leak.</p>
<h2 id="other-methods">Other Methods</h2>
<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll describe other less common methods that can seem to be a cost-effective option at first.</p>
<h3 id="linux-pre-installed-pcs">Linux Pre-installed PCs</h3>
<p>Several manufactures are selling Linux pre-installed PCs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never purchased this, but when considering the fact that web systems are running on Linux, these PCs seem like a perfect development environment.<br>
However, the fact that several applications related to web development, for example, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office can&rsquo;t be used could be a critical problem.</p>
<p>Another problem is that there is very little information available because there are only a small number of shipments.</p>
<p>Many Linux OSs are free, so you could install them on your desktop anytime.<br>
Or, you could try Linux via Virtual Box, Hyper-V, and other virtualization software.</p>
<p>Both methods are safer than buying a Linux pre-installed PC.</p>
<h3 id="chromebook">Chromebook</h3>
<p>Chromebook is a cheap and lightweight laptop.<br>
This laptop is designed mainly to run the Chrome browser. The OS is Chrome OS, and is Linux based.</p>
<p>However, Chrome OS is a specialized Linux distribution that is not the same as others when developing and running web applications.<br>
And, this laptop has the same problem as the one I mentioned above: it can&rsquo;t run Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>Raspberry Pi is a cheap and small computer designed for education, not a dessert.<br>
You could buy the highest model of this series for less than <code>$100</code>, and you can use it as a regular PC by connecting displays and a keyboard.</p>
<p>However, Raspberry Pi is powered by an Arm CPU, so the &ldquo;instruction set architecture&rdquo; is different from typical PCs and Intel Macs.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>In this article, I described the PCs and development environment for developing web applications I recommend based on my experience.<br>
If I have the opportunity later, I wish to describe each item in more detail.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m sure you would be able to get good results by choosing other PCs and other development environments.</p>
<p>It will make me happy if this article provides tips and helps improve skills to those of you who are trying to build your own PCs and development environment.<br>
Moreover, by arranging your development environment as I&rsquo;ve described in this article, your work style and your development style will probably become more clearer.</p>
<p>As you become able to visualize the kind of web developer you want to be more clearly, it will become easier to find the workplace that matches you accurately.</p>
<p>I hope the contents I described in this article will help you clarify your career goals.</p>
