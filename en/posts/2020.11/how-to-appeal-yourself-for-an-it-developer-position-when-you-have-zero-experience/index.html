        <h1>How to Appeal Yourself for an It Developer Position When You Have Zero Experience</h1>
      </div>
      <p>In this article, I describe how to effectively convey your background in order to get a job as an IT developer when you have limited or no experience.</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;inexperienced&rdquo; I&rsquo;m referring to those who have never had any job in the IT category and have had no chance to take Computer Science classes.<br>
The conditions and methods aren&rsquo;t dependent on age, educational backgrounds, gender.</p>
<p>The methods I&rsquo;m describing in this article are based on my career. I&rsquo;ll also be referring to the career of other IT developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ordinary IT developer. I don&rsquo;t have any internationally renowned skills or legendary achievements.<br>
However, I&rsquo;ve been accumulating experience in the IT category for over 10 years and I&rsquo;m working as an IT developer even now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking mainly of Japan, but I don&rsquo;t think the methods are region-specific.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-appeal">How to Appeal</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to convey what&rsquo;s great about your experience and skills.<br>
It&rsquo;s especially important to find methods that effectively convey your experience when they are limited.</p>
<p>However, you may think, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any great experience, and I can&rsquo;t convey my achievements effectively.&rdquo;<br>
Many people are not good at appealing themselves to others. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m the same too.</p>
<p>You may have felt sad, and thought &ldquo;I wish I could appeal myself more effectively.&rdquo;<br>
Though, appeals that are too strong are not good and companies want honest employees.</p>
<p>The methods I recommend are as follows. You can start any of these anytime, and there is little cost involved.<br>
Furthermore, all methods demonstrate your efforts, thus it will increase opportunities for your abilities to be understood by companies.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-free-github-account-and-publish-your-code-on-github">Get the Free GitHub Account and Publish Your Code on GitHub</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a renowned web service for managing source code and you can use many of their features with a free account.</p>
<p>GitHub provides many features which will make it easy to use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> a version management system.<br>
Hence, many IT developers in the world have been using Git and GitHub, although its name is a bit funny.<br>
Many web services in the world, apps in your smartphone, and their related technologies are developed on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t used GitHub, I recommend you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">create a free account</a>.</p>
<p>Or, if you have had a GitHub account in the past, and you haven&rsquo;t used it recently, I recommend you log in again with your account.</p>
<p>First, you should create a repository. Next, you should run <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code> to your GitHub repository. It&rsquo;s okay even if it&rsquo;s just a practice or a sample.<br>
Even if it&rsquo;s your first time to hear the words &ldquo;repository&rdquo;,<code>git commit</code> or <code>git push</code>, it&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>You can start learning from now!</p>
<p>Here are some Japanese titles will help newcomers:</p>
<ul>
<li>いちばんやさしい Git&amp;GitHub の教本(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07LBSWJNP">Amazon.co.jp</a>)</li>
<li>わかばちゃんと学ぶ Git 使い方入門(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B071D4D6XX">Amazon.co.jp</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>On GitHub, you can choose whether to make your repository, which is a set of codes, public or private.<br>
If you set your repository to public, it could be seen by anyone, including those who don&rsquo;t know you.<br>
If you set the repository to private, the repository cloud be seen by you and anyone you choose.</p>
<p>However, you can update your setting to public or private. So you can set the repository to private at first if you are not comfortable making your code public on it.</p>
<p>One important point is that if you write your repository URL in your resume, you should make sure your repository is set to public.<br>
If you had given your repository to a recruiter but set your repository to private, they won&rsquo;t be able to see your repository, then you might miss a valuable opportunity.</p>
<p>By the way, GitHub will help you by recording your steps automatically.<br>
GitHub has features to record your activities and demonstrate every step.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="https://github.com/mazgi">my activities on GitHub</a>.<br>
On GitHub there is a colorful area as follows, which changes into a deeper color when you increase your activities.</p>
<p><img src="github-grass-graph.png" alt="github-grass-graph"></p>
<p>This feature will show your activities and support your motivation for continuing your GitHub efforts.</p>
<h3 id="build-your-website-and-publish-it">Build Your Website and Publish It</h3>
<p>Recently, many people have their own websites, and you may have one too.<br>
Publishing your website, building, and maintaining it, will be a good way to showcase yourself.</p>
<h4 id="the-pros-of-publishing-a-website">The Pros of Publishing a Website</h4>
<p>By adding the URL of your website in your resume, you can communicate the detailed work you&rsquo;ve done to the job recruiter.<br>
Thus, if you update your daily efforts on your website, it will become a good way to appeal yourself.</p>
<p>For example, contents such as these will communicate your achievements well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Records of your learning</li>
<li>Your commentary describing books and samples</li>
<li>Survey and results that you&rsquo;re interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you feel it&rsquo;s easier to publish movies on YouTube which has your website embedded, this would be a good method too.</p>
<h4 id="the-pros-of-building-a-website">The Pros of Building a Website</h4>
<p>When you publish a website, you technically need to have skills ranging from web frontend to IT infrastructure.<br>
If you were to develop skills for building websites beyond writing articles, that will be regarded as a good achievement too.</p>
<p>One example is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>: An easy website hosting service which you can use free with your GitHub account.<br>
There are other cloud services you could choose to publish your website for free or for the const of a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>As follows are popular services in the 2020s.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> + <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html">Set up custom domains</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase Hosting</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain">Connect a custom domain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain">Configuring an apex domain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">Custom domains</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains">Custom Domains</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, if you can pay about $10 or more annually, you can register your custom domain with the following services.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Route 53</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html">Registering a new domain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs">Cloud Domains</a></li>
<li><a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By building your website using the above services, you will be able to gain a higher reputation.</p>
<p>Even if the contents are unrelated to the position you are going for, your website building skills you acquired would be a good topic when you meet the recruiter. For example, you can say &ldquo;I like X, so I built this website to describe X. The system structure is &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="get-qualified">Get Qualified</h3>
<p>Currently, you don&rsquo;t need any certificates to become an IT developer.<br>
Nevertheless, several well-known certificates can probably demonstrate your effort and the specialized knowledge you have.</p>
<p>In Japan, there are the two <a href="https://www.jitec.ipa.go.jp/2_01english/02examcategories.html">following examinations</a> that are recommended for all IT developer positions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination</li>
<li>Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there are the following private certificates that are effective and popular.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification">Google Cloud certification</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If anyone knows about the certificate <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a>, please tell me.</em></p>
<p>However, as a matter of fact, nothing beats school grades.<br>
This is the truth, even if you want to bury your head in the sand.</p>
<p>If you have the opportunity to go on to the next level of education, I really recommend you to choose that.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
<p>In this article, I described how to effectively convey your backgrounds, efforts, and achievements to get an IT developer position.</p>
<p>Though, you may feel the methods I described are difficult for you at the moment.<br>
Perhaps you may need to study more in order to realize your goals, such as how I described in this article.</p>
<p>However, all of the methods I described above in order to appeal to companies could be realized using regular skills that any ordinary IT developer in the 2020s would have.<br>
In other words, the difference comes down to whether you study the skills after getting a job or acquiring the skills before it.</p>
<p>So if you could increase the probability of getting a good position by acquiring skills early, and you could make use of your skills after getting the job, then there is no question that is better.</p>
<p>These methods that I&rsquo;ve introduced might not necessarily be pleasing to the ear.<br>
These methods require your daily efforts, even if you succeed, you won&rsquo;t earn over $100,000 anytime soon.</p>
<p>However, I do think that my advice will help newcomers who are trying to start out as IT developers.<br>
It will make me happy if this article could provide tips to those of you who are trying to become an IT developer and are seeking effective methods to achieve this.</p>
